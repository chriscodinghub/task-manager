## Welcome to my task-manager!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.

+ I learned how to install node.js and dependancies.
+ I learned how to modularize router files to keep files clean.
+ I learned how to GET, POST and DELETE data from databases.
+ I learned how to launch applications through Heroku.

## Functions of my App
+ With the user starts the app, the home page will be displayed.
+ Then if the user clicks the button Get Started, they will be redirrected to a second page.
+ On the center of the page Note Title and Note Text can be clicked on and text can then be input by user.
+ Once the user has input the Title and Text they a new button will appear Save Note on the top right of the page.
+ If the user clicks Save Note, their text will be logged to the database and appended to the left hand side of the page.
+ The user can then either click on their titles of previous saves to bring up the file, or click the trash can icon to delete that file.
